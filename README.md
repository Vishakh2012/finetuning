## **Fine-Tuning DistilBERT for Text Classification**

Welcome to the Jupyter notebook project for fine-tuning the DistilBERT model from Hugging Face for text classification tasks using TensorFlow and Keras. This project serves as a practical guide for understanding the process of fine-tuning pre-trained models and encourages you to contribute by experimenting with different models and datasets.
Overview

In this project, we explore the fine-tuning process for text classification using the DistilBERT model. DistilBERT is a distilled version of BERT, designed for efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. You can adapt this project to various text classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis, topic classification, or custom NLP problems.
Getting Started
Prerequisites

Before running the Jupyter notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

    Python 3.x
    TensorFlow
    Hugging Face Transformers
    Jupyter Notebook

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash

pip install tensorflow transformers jupyter

```

### **Clone the Repository**

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/finetune-distilbert.git
```

Notebook

To run the fine-tuning Jupyter notebook, navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter notebook:

```bash

cd finetune-distilbert
jupyter notebook fine_tune_distilbert.ipynb
```
